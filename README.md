"Decision Tree ISDA 140" is a Jupyter Notebook project using decision tree classification with the Wine dataset. Built for ISDA 140 coursework, this project explores model accuracy based on varying min_samples_split values using scikit-learn. Includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.

"Meteorite Landings Assignment" is a Python script that reads a CSV file of meteorite landings, parses and structures the data into dictionaries, and exports the result as a formatted JSON file.

"Final Project" done in Jupyter Notebook explores and analyzes data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), specifically focusing on nutrition, physical activity, and obesity trends in the United States.

üîç Key Features: -Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized column names. -Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis of physical activity and obesity rates. -Correlation analysis between physical activity and obesity. -Yearly trends in obesity rates using line plots. -Heatmaps and boxplots for visualizing relationships and distributions across states. -Data Merging: Combined datasets to analyze how physical activity levels relate to obesity at the state and national levels.

üìà Tools & Libraries: -pandas for data manipulation -matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

üîó Dataset: -Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - BRFSS -Public health dataset tracking health behaviors across U.S. states over time.# ISDA-decision-tree--Python-project
